This constrained delaunay triangulation implementation is based on:

Domiter, Vid. "Constrained Delaunay triangulation using plane subdivision." 
Proceedings of the 8th central European seminar on computer graphics. 
Budmerice. 2004.

While this code makes heavy use of the JTS port, it is all new code. As such 
it can fall under the MIT license.
